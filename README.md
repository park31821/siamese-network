# siamese-network

Deep neural networks have been widely used to train and learn features from the data given to provide a classification model. However, the main limitation it possesses is that it requires a lot of labelled data for training, which can be sometimes difficult in real-world applications in terms of feasibility and cost. Therefore, the Siamese network became more popular for tasks that involve finding similarity or learning equivalence relations between objects since it requires a small amount of data for training. Siamese neural network contains two or more identical sub-networks with shared weights followed by a distance calculation layer. The network will take two images as inputs with target values of 0 if two images are from the same class or 1 if they are from different classes. The vectors of input images produced by the network will be used to calculate the distance between the images to the model and learn by optimizing the loss function. This file will build two different Siamese networks using different loss functions, contrastive loss and triplet loss, on the Omniglot dataset.
